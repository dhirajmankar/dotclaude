Global and project-level Claude Code configuration — skills, commands, agents, and helpers.

## Structure

```
skills/                  ← 25 global skills, synced to ~/.claude/skills/
projects/
  studiobooks/           ← StudioBooks project config
    skills/              ← sb-*, v3-*, agentdb-*, github-*, reasoningbank-*
    commands/
    agents/
    helpers/
skills-lock.json         ← global skill registry (name → source)
sync.ps1                 ← syncs global + project skills to the local machine
projects.local.json      ← machine-specific project paths (gitignored, create manually)
config/                  ← global CLAUDE.md and settings templates
```

## Quick start (new machine)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/dhirajmankar/dotclaude C:\Users\Work\dotclaude
cd C:\Users\Work\dotclaude

# 1. Create projects.local.json with paths for projects you have checked out
#    (see "Project path config" below)

# 2. Run sync — installs global skills + project configs
.\sync.ps1
```

## Project path config

`projects.local.json` maps project names to their `.claude` directories.
This file is gitignored because paths differ per machine.

```json
{
  "studiobooks": "C:\\Users\\Work\\StudioBooks\\.claude"
}
```

Create it manually after cloning. Only include projects you have checked out locally.

## How Claude Code finds skills

Claude Code loads skills from two places:
- **Global:** `~/.claude/skills/` — available in every project
- **Project-level:** `<project_root>/.claude/skills/` — loaded when working in that project

`sync.ps1` writes to both locations so skills are always discoverable.

## Adding a global skill

1. Add the skill folder to `skills/<name>/`
2. Add an entry to `skills-lock.json`
3. Run `.\sync.ps1`
4. Commit and push

## Adding a project-level skill

1. Add the skill folder to `projects/<project>/skills/<name>/`
2. Run `.\sync.ps1` — it copies the skill into the project's `.claude/skills/`
3. Commit and push
